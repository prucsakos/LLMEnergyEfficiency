Question:
"Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?"

Thinkink process + answer:
"My reasoning process:

1. First, I need to find out how many eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market every day.

To do this, I will divide the number of eggs she has left after eating three for breakfast and baking muffins for her friends by the selling price of $2 per egg.

Number of eggs left = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs

Selling price per egg = $2

Number of eggs sold = 9 eggs / $2 per egg = 4.5 eggs

So, Janet sells 4.5 eggs at the farmers' market every day.

2. Next, I need to find out how much money Janet makes from selling these eggs.

I will multiply the number of eggs sold by the selling price per egg.

Money made per day = 4.5 eggs x $2 per egg = $9

So, Janet makes $9 per day at the farmers' market."

"$9"
